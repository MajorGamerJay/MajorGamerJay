MajorGamerJay's Portage configuration for GNU/Linux

I use Gentoo Linux's package manager Portage to get softwares within the
distribution. It is a highly configurable source-based package manager that
compiles the programs with according to feature flags (e.g. USE flags).

A few things before using my configuration for any purposes. Always
remember that consistency > convenience; using it directly will break your
system. Start with no USE flags, and then slowly build up to all the
features to make your new Gentoo system.

I will make a tutorial about this soon.
