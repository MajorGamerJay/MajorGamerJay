# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## ***c'mere my little pogchamp***
### A few notes
- :fire: I'm deleting all repositories that are merely guides for doing certain actions. (Like, installing arch-linux, etc.)
- :sun_with_face: Once my pull requests are merged, I will delete my forks of other repositories.
- :jack_o_lantern: Some of my repositories are forks of others where I perform my own build. (dwm, dmenu etc.)
- :nut_and_bolt: I don't have a certain dotfiles repository but I have a portage-config
- :hearts: To see all my guides/documented contents, please check [this](https://majorgamerjay.github.io/content/index.html)

:turtle: Here's my website! [link](https://majorgamerjay.github.io/index.html)
